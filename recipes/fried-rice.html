        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A wonderfully aromatic Chinese fried rice, inspired by Uncle Roger. Fried rice is an easily accessible recipe
            that can be cooked at home. Ideally, you will want to cook this in a wok, for the "wok hei" (the breath of the wok)
        </p>
        <p>
            The ingredients can be adapted to your taste and to your choice of protein. MSG is highly recommended, however.
